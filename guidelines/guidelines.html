        If you are reading this post, then you are probably trying to transition
        into tech or you are a junior developer. Even if you are a developer who
        has some years under your belt, this article can be of help in some
        parts of your website development journey.

        from being a beginner to landing your first job as a developer.

      <p class="_3">
        I have a simple roadmap called
        <span> LMAP(Learn.Build.Apply.Prepare).</span>
        First you learn the necessary technologies and concepts needed. You then
        build projects, resume and linkedin profile. After these steps, you can
        start applying for jobs. As you are applying, you have to start
        preparing for interviews by learning Data Structures and Algorithms.

            The process of creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website or
            Web application so that a user can see and interact with them
            directly is known as front-end web development, sometimes known as
            client-side development. Technologies to learn : HTML, CSS, JS, a
            frmawork(React, Vue, Angular or svelte).

            Back-end Development refers to server-side programming. Scripting,
            databases, and website architecture are the main topics. It includes
            background processes that take place when a user makes any activity
            on a website. Technologies to learn :One Backend language(Node, PHP,
            Python,Ruby,Java, Go or others) DB(Mongodb, mysql,postgres and

            <p class="_8">
                After learning  the necessary technologies, you have to demonstrate to prospective employers
                that you really know the technologies and you an put them to use. The only way to do that
                is by building projects.
                ANother reason why projects are important is because, you have little or no experience so the 
                only way to access your skills is through your projects.
                Also take note, don't put youtube tutorial projects like todo app and weather app on your resume.
                These projects are too simple and easy to build and the recruiters won't be impressed whit them.
                Be creative with your projects and also be redy to do difficult and amazing stuff.

                LinkedIn is a social networking site created for the business community. 
                The website's objective is to make it possible for registered users to create and maintain
                 professional networks of people they know and trust.
               Professionals can use LinkedIn to locate employment, and learn 
               the latest business and industry news.
               For you to standout from the crowd of developers out there on linkedin, you have to optimize your
               profile.
                I know a lot of people who got jobs they didn't apply for just beause their profiles
               attracted recruiters. THis can easily be you if you take it seriously.

                It's time to talk about resume. Your resume is a one page summary of you as a developer.
                Yes, only one page is okay to convey all the information about you.
                Word on the streets is that recruiters only spend 7seconds on a resume, yes you read that right.
                Only 7seconds so you have to put your best foot forward.
                The four basic  and necessary sections you should put on your resume are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> work experience</li>
                <li>projects</li>
                <li>skills</li>
                <li>education</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="_11">
                you can go further and  add some other sections like summary, certifications and achievements.
